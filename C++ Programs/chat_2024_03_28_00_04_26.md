Of course! Here's a simple example problem along with its solution:

Problem: Write a Python program to calculate the factorial of a number entered by the user.

Solution:
1. Ask the user to enter a number for which they want to calculate the factorial.
2. Read the input number from the user and store it in a variable.
3. Initialize a variable to store the factorial value and set it to 1 initially.
4. Run a loop starting from 1 up to the entered number.
5. Multiply the factorial value by the current number in each iteration.
6. Finally, print out the factorial value.

Here is the Python code for the solution:

```python
# Ask the user to enter a number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Initialize factorial value to 1
factorial = 1

# Calculate the factorial
for i in range(1, num + 1):
    factorial = factorial * i

# Print the factorial value
print(f"The factorial of {num} is: {factorial}")
```

This program will calculate the factorial of the number entered by the user and display the result.
